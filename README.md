INTRODUCTION
  Communication is an important part of everyone’s life whether it is long distance communication or short distance. The development of technology has given rise to the establishment of multiple telecom sectors. With the increase in the count of telecom industry the competition among them is also increasing rapidly. In addition to acquiring the new customers retaining the old customers has also become an important goal of many telecom companies. All the telecom sectors are after building the best predictive model to determine the customer who are about to churn
In today's landscape, telecom companies are grappling with vast amounts of data generated at unprecedented rates. With numerous providers vying for market share, customers are presented with a plethora of options, ranging from enhanced services to more affordable offerings. In this fiercely competitive environment, telecom companies are focused on maximizing profitability and maintaining market dominance.
Churn analysis aims to predict customers who are likely to discontinue their use of a particular service or product. This analysis relies on data mining methodologies to uncover patterns and indicators associated with potential churn behavior. Given the competitive market environment, effective churn analysis is crucial for telecom companies to retain customers and stay ahead of the competition.
However, analyzing churn in large datasets poses challenges due to the sheer volume of customer information. To address this, preprocessing techniques and dimensionality reduction methods are employed to streamline the dataset and build predictive models efficiently. Preprocessing involves tasks like removing duplicate instances, handling missing values, and eliminating irrelevant records. Subsequently, attribute count reduction is achieved through feature selection and feature extraction methods.
By leveraging churn analysis, telecom companies can accurately predict which customers are likely to churn by assigning probability scores to each individual. This analysis can be tailored based on customer segments and the potential monetary loss associated with each churn. Armed with these insights, companies can enhance their communication strategies with customers to foster increased loyalty and retention.
By calculating metrics such as churn rate or customer attrition, companies can develop targeted marketing campaigns aimed at retaining customers and mitigating potential losses.

Statistical approaches, including regression-based techniques, have also proven effective in predicting and estimating churn. Techniques such as regression trees, decision trees, rules-based learning, and neural networks have been utilized for customer history analysis and prediction. Naive Bayes, a guided learning module, has been used for churn prediction based on Bayesian principles.
Hybrid techniques, such as KNN-LR (Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbor), have demonstrated superior performance compared to individual approaches. In the subsequent step, various classification algorithms are applied to categorize customers into churn and non-churn categories. These algorithms include Random Tree (RT), Random Forest (RF), Decision Stump, AdaboostM1 + Decision Stump, Bagging + Random Tree, Naïve Bayes (NB), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Logistic Regression (LR)
